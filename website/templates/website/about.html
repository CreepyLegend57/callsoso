      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Call Soso is a Milton Keynes–based circular economy venture working at the
        intersection of corporate surplus, creative reuse, and community impact.
        We capture materials that would otherwise be discarded and redirect them
        into meaningful second lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        From cardboard and textiles to foam and product returns, we work with
        businesses, upcyclers, designers, and educators to transform waste into
        value — socially, environmentally, and economically.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <div class="about-cards">
        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>Capture</h3>
          <p>
            We partner with organisations to identify surplus materials across
            their operations — packaging, textiles, offcuts, returns, and more.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>Match</h3>
          <p>
            Materials are matched with internal teams, makers, creatives, and
            community groups who can reuse them effectively.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>Transform</h3>
          <p>
            Surplus becomes new products, installations, learning tools, or
            resources — extending material life and reducing waste.

      <p>
        We reinvest 10% of our profits into the Call Soso Foundation, supporting
        workshops, educational programmes, and hands-on learning experiences for
        communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        These initiatives empower people to understand materials, develop
        creative confidence, and participate directly in the circular economy.
